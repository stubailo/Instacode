        <h3>What is InstaCode?</h3>

        <p class="lead">InstaCode lets you effortlessly get set up to build
          websites with Meteor, 
          even if you have never used Linux or a terminal before.</p>

        <p>
          It comes with:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>One step installers for Windows and Mac</li>
          <li>A code editor called <a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a></li>
          <li>A <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Linux Virtual Machine</a> so that you can enjoy the benefits of the world's most popular web server system while programming in your favorite OS</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/">Git</a> integration for version control, code sharing, and downloading examples</li>
          <li>A toolbar of common <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a> commands so that you can make, run, and launch a real website with a few clicks</li>
          <li>Pre-packaged installers for many other languages such as Ruby and Python (coming soon!)</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Why We Are Working On It</h3>

        <p class="lead">
          Programming for beginners comes with a steep learning curve.</p>

        <p>This is because:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Most online tutorials assume readers are using linux and are already familiar with common terminal commands. In reality, most beginners have Windows and have never used the terminal before.</li>
          <li>Setting up a programming environment is tedious and unintuitive. Downloading and installing all the necessary tools and software is  discouraging to beginners.</li>
          <li>There is a significant disconnect between beginner coding tutorials and real life problems. Someone could have been learning Java for years and yet struggle to apply their skills on useful projects.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>We started working on InstaCode at <a href="http://hackprinceton.com/">
          HackPrinceton 2014</a> to help remove these barriers to entry. Our goal
          is to make it so that everyone can get started programming without
          being discouraged by the setup process.</p>

        <br />
        <h3>Who We Are</h3>

        <p> We are MIT CS students who love programming and want to share our
          passion with the world.</p>
